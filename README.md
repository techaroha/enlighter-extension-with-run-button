### Data Usage ###
The "Enlighter – Extension With Run Button" plugin operates by sending code data to a compiler for execution on compiler servers. By default, it utilizes the Newtum compiler and its servers for this purpose. It's crucial to note that this plugin accesses only the publicly available source code on your WordPress website and does not gather or transmit any other data.

The data transmission is essential to enable the execution of code examples seamlessly. When you click the "Run" button, the plugin securely forwards the code to the compiler server, which processes the code and returns the result. This process ensures that users can interact with and see the outcomes of the code they are exploring in real-time.

Rest assured, the plugin maintains a strict focus on code execution and does not access or share any private or sensitive data from your website, preserving the security and privacy of your information.

### Why Only Newtum Compiler ###
The "Enlighter – Extension With Run Button" plugin offers a default integration with the Newtum Online Compiler, ensuring smooth code execution for your website's interactive code blocks. However, we understand that different users may have varying preferences or requirements when it comes to their choice of online compiler.

That's why we've designed the plugin to be flexible and adaptable to your needs. If you wish to use a different online compiler powered by the Techaroha AI Compiler, it's as easy as obtaining an API key from your preferred compiler and simply submitting it in the plugin's settings.

We value user feedback and continuously strive to enhance the plugin's capabilities. If you have a specific online compiler in mind that you'd like to see integrated into the plugin, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. You can use our convenient contact form at [https://techaroha.com/contact/](https://techaroha.com/contact/) or send us an email at [support@techaroha.com](mailto:support@techaroha.com).

However, we're excited to share that our dedicated development team is hard at work to expand the plugin's compatibility.

### Languages Supported ###
The "Enlighter – Extension With Run Button" plugin boasts compatibility with a wide array of programming languages, making it a versatile tool for your coding needs. Our approach to language support is simple and efficient: we seamlessly pass the language information from your Enlighter code blocks directly to the online compiler.

However, it's important to note that not all programming languages may be supported by the online compiler. In the event that the selected language is not supported, the plugin will gracefully handle the situation by returning the respective error message. This error message is then displayed to the user who has clicked on the "Run" button, ensuring a transparent and user-friendly experience.

We're committed to enhancing language support and making your coding experience as seamless as possible. If you have specific programming languages in mind that you'd like to see added to the list of supported languages, please feel free to request them through our dedicated link at [https://techaroha.com/ai-compiler/](https://techaroha.com/ai-compiler/).
